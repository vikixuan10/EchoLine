1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:02,373
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:07,008
How did the job stuff go? He offered me one!

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:11,484
You know what? This calls for a bottle of lsrael's finest!

4
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:14,918
The job is in Paris.

5
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:23,323
Oh, God, please, somebody say something.

6
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:27,261
So if you take this job, you'll be moving to Paris?

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:30,405
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

8
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:37,737
I know, it's huge, and it's scary and it's really far away from you guys.

9
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:40,205
But this is such an incredible opportunity for me.

10
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:42,878
I've already told them about our situation with Emma,

11
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:47,403
and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. OK.

12
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:51,187
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out. Anything we want.

13
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,288
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.

14
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:05,606
All right. We'll work it out. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

15
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:11,380
You sure this is what you want? I think it is.

16
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:18,786
What's going on? I got a really incredible job offer.

17
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:21,215
Hey, great! All right! Good for you!

18
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:23,260
It's in Paris. What?

19
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:29,532
No, no, no! No, no, no! No, too much is changing, okay?

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,396
First Phoebe getting married. Congratulations.

21
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,569
And then these two move in to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

22
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,791
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive.

23
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:41,110
It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!

24
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:45,373
You guys, this is really, really important to me.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,984
It means a lot if you could try to get onboard.

26
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:51,681
Of course we can. Congratulations. Thank you.

27
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:53,988
Joey?

28
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:58,333
No, my hugs are reserved for people staying in America!

29
00:01:58,662 --> 00:01:59,690
Joey, it would mean...

30
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:02,819
No! Get your France-going arms away from me!

31
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:08,132
Are you okay with this? Well, it makes me feel sad, but...

32
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,366
Talking to Ross. I see.

33
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:16,477
Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day?

34
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:18,472
How could I be okay with this?

35
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,017
But what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.

36
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:26,919
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her her old job back, she would take it?

37
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:28,449
How's that gonna happen?

38
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,120
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?

39
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:35,365
Like, I don't know, I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

40
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:38,868
I met him at that Christmas party. I mean, we really hit it off.

41
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,330
The guy who kept calling you "Ron"? I didn't say we were brothers!

42
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:22,999
Hey, Phoebe. Hey. Hi.

43
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:29,101
Tell me what you think. The house next door to the one that we're buying just went on the market.

44
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,358
I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.

45
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:32,587
We close escrow tomorrow.

46
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:36,707
So seeing another house can only confuse us. We're easily confused. We're not very bright.

47
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,584
But what if it's better than ours? Shouldn't we at least look?

48
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,222
What do you think, Pheebs?

49
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:48,696
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

50
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,431
Anyway....

51
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,473
Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? Yeah.

52
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,168
She died. You're kidding!

53
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,010
That's terrible. Yeah, last Saturday.

54
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:08,610
Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic!

55
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,111
Wait a minute, I read the wrong one. Oh, yeah?

56
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,419
Yeah, she was just an agent.

57
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:23,623
Joey's gonna be so upset. I know. He always wanted to be the
first black man to cross the Atlantic.

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,031
We cannot tell Joey about this.

59
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:28,595
He's already flipping out about everything changing.

60
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,468
This'll push him over the edge.

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,168
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him? Not for a little while.

62
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:36,211
Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.

63
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,678
What if he reads the paper?

64
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:41,715
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.

65
00:04:47,924 --> 00:04:51,360
May I help you? Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

66
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,758
Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.

67
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:59,261
Oh, right. Don? Close. Ron.

68
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:03,105
Well, what can I do for you?

69
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:07,905
Well, I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.

70
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,877
Did she ask you to come here and do this?

71
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,208
First I have to get you to agree...

72
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:16,251
...then we'll see if she wants to come back.

73
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,611
Wow, that is tempting.

74
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:27,122
She loved her job here. Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?

75
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:30,894
She is good. I took a shot there.

76
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,768
But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

77
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:37,665
Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.

78
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,335
I see.

79
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:43,409
Thanks very much.

80
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,548
Is this your son? Yeah, his name is Ross.

81
00:05:55,224 --> 00:06:00,355
What? Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

82
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,967
Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?

83
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,127
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

84
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:18,507
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us...

85
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:21,345
...and he can touch anything he wants?

86
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:30,190
I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.

87
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,991
Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.

88
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:39,101
You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!

89
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:46,534
You could really arrange that? You let Rachel come back and it's done.

90
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,509
I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,110
Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.

92
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:56,243
I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.

93
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,310
That's great. I worry about little Ross.

94
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:01,980
He's always reading, collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

95
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,619
He'll be fine!

96
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,163
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.

97
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,300
Everything okay? I'm just mad at my agent.

98
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,094
Estelle? Why?

99
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,732
There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...

100
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:21,002
...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.

101
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,477
I'm guessing she does.

102
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:27,377
Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.

103
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,419
No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.

104
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:35,055
Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.

105
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,987
Well, okay. Why?

106
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:43,029
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.

107
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,665
I love that saying!

108
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,043
Hello? Joey, it's Estelle.

109
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,619
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.

110
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:08,518
It's a little coincidental, but believable.

111
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:15,857
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.

112
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:17,295
Yeah, actually I am.

113
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,335
I guess I dropped the ball there.

114
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:26,040
That's it? You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.

115
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,634
Don't take that tone with me. Who do you think you are?

116
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:34,909
Alan Lemon, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?

117
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,953
No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...

118
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,247
...and you're not getting me any auditions and I'm tired of it.

119
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,451
What are you saying?

120
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:51,626
I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle? You're fired. Goodbye.

121
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:55,431
Man, tough week for Estelle.

122
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,839
Hi. Hi.

123
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,477
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.

124
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:07,446
You know she can't sleep without it. Well, she's asleep now.

125
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:10,848
Stop forcing that thing on her. Okay.

126
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:13,812
You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!

127
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:17,083
Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!

128
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,957
No! I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

129
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,699
They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.

130
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,736
I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!

131
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:31,304
So you're not going to Paris? No, I'm still going!

132
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,972
What?

133
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:43,973
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, they offered me more money!

134
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,577
Ross, isn't that great?

135
00:09:55,598 --> 00:10:00,160
Hi. We're buying the house next door. Could we just take a look around?

136
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:04,170
Sure, I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.

137
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:06,873
I feel like we're cheating on our house.

138
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:13,176
If we cheat, shouldn't it be with a hot, younger house that does stuff that our house won't do?

139
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:17,815
Ours is so much better!

140
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:21,855
This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave.

141
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,355
What a hole!

142
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,984
So, what do you think? Love it!

143
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,696
We already have one offer. I think the lady upstairs will make another one.

144
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,567
They could be our neighbors. What are they like?

145
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:37,097
The woman upstairs is nice. She and her husband have two kids.

146
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:42,838
He's on Wall Street, and she's a-- Oh... my... God!

147
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:53,846
Sure.

148
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,891
Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?

149
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,225
Are you okay?

150
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:07,528
Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

151
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,969
This has gotta be killing her.

152
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,873
No, that wouldn't kill her.

153
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:17,409
A coronary embolism might.

154
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:21,443
I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.

155
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,743
Except for this guy who eats paper.

156
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:26,910
And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.

157
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:32,086
Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for 10 years.

158
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:36,927
I'm gonna call her and hire her again. No, no, no! Don't call her.

159
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:40,695
You wait for her to call you. Why?

160
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:45,331
Because patience is the road to understanding.

161
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,233
Which is the key to a happy heart.

162
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,072
You blow me away.

163
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,542
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?

164
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,879
I promise. Okay.

165
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:04,254
And that means never having to give a reason.

166
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:10,090
What a small world!

167
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:13,459
And yet I never run into Beyoncé.

168
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,835
You two know each other?

169
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:24,403
We go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin.

170
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,247
So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?

171
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:32,519
Are we gonna have a bidding war? I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

172
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,355
Don't-- Don't-- Don't--

173
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,663
No, actually, we are buying the house next door.

174
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:39,602
Why?

175
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,773
I don't know why.

176
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,502
Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.

177
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:51,372
But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?

178
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:53,678
Now we have to get it!

179
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,049
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

180
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,886
This cannot be happening.

181
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,494
The realtor said another couple made an offer.

182
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:10,326
Maybe the Janices won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,937
The only way that'll happen is if the other couple are the Hitlers!

184
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,643
Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?

185
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:24,308
We can turn this one into a guesthouse! That's a great idea!

186
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,741
By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful but...

187
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,719
...when did you start crapping money?

188
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,412
You come up with an idea. All right.

189
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,990
We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.

190
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,754
We can still get out. But we love our house.

191
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,728
Will we love it so much with her next door?

192
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:42,824
And she's gonna be louder out here too!

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,458
Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"

194
00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:51,003
Okay. But if we don't get this house, she'll still show up wherever we go.

195
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,234
At least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise.

196
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,902
Never again will you have to hear the three words...

197
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,040
...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!

198
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:10,418
Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.

199
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,894
Oh, that does it too.

200
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
Who is it?

201
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:25,932
It's me. Ron.

202
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,705
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

203
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,650
...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.

204
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:40,920
This may surprise you, but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.

205
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,792
Just hear me out.

206
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,260
How would you feel about offering her a raise?

207
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,500
Not good, Ron.

208
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,836
Perhaps I can persuade you.

209
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,668
What if you could give your son...

210
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:05,645
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

211
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,950
Wow! That's pretty cool.

212
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,623
So? Do we have a deal?

213
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,390
Okay, you got it. Yes! Yes!

214
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,694
This is gonna make me very popular.

215
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,963
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

216
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,973
I meant with my son.

217
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:38,310
Good, because the ladies, not so much.

218
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:51,024
Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.

219
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:54,487
I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.

220
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,292
I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her...

221
00:15:57,467 --> 00:16:00,994
...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 10.

222
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,002
Hope you can make it.

223
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,965
Oh, my God.

224
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:17,746
Hello? Joey, it's Estelle.

225
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:24,717
Estelle?

226
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:30,265
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.

227
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:38,938
Okay. I just-- I can't believe you're calling me.

228
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,133
I didn't think I should just drop by.

229
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:44,212
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

230
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:50,115
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.

231
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,653
Can I ask you something?

232
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,156
What's it like there?

233
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,927
It's all right.

234
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,087
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

235
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:04,461
Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge!

236
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:08,297
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

237
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,466
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!

238
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:21,176
Well, I just talked to Sid.

239
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,013
We are definitely putting in an offer on the house.

240
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:26,155
And I'll bet we get it!

241
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:29,156
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

242
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,663
All right, I gotta run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.

243
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:37,493
I'll see you later, neighbor.

244
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,593
Wait!

245
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,704
I just want you to know that I'm so happy you're going to be here.

246
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,036
Oh, me too!

247
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,973
Because...

248
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:51,011
...that way...

249
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:54,479
...we can pick up where we left off.

250
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:01,221
I never stopped loving you.

251
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,224
Oh... my-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:08,993
I want you.

253
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,861
I need you.

254
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:15,994
I must have you, Janice Litman-Goralnik neé Hosenstein.

255
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:22,334
Chandler, what are you talking about?

256
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:26,373
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.

257
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,041
Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.

258
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,687
I don't know what to say.

259
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:38,517
I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.

260
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,501
Obviously.

261
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:48,830
But I love my husband.

262
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:51,371
And I know you love your wife.

263
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,305
I don't think we should get this house now.

264
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,674
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream and take it away.

265
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:02,382
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.

266
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:04,820
I understand.

267
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,050
Although....

268
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:11,823
Maybe just one last moment of weakness.

269
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,934
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

270
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:34,915
They're never coming down now!

271
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:39,479
Hi. Hi!

272
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:43,719
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.

273
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:44,651
What?

274
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:48,391
Ralph Lauren called, again, and they offered me more money.

275
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:53,632
They did? Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

276
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:57,138
Zelner called me and said, "We will do anything we can to get you back."

277
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,734
And that I should thank some "Ron."

278
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,072
I don't even know what department that guy's in!

279
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:06,941
So, what are you gonna do? Well, I took it!

280
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,644
That's great! So you're staying in New York!

281
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,626
You're excited, right? You know-- Look, the money's great.

282
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:22,827
It's certainly the easier choice. Right.

283
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:27,359
But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.

284
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:32,073
Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?

285
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,564
Oh, absolutely.

286
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,514
Yeah, but you know, this is....

287
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:48,585
It's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.

288
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:54,489
I had no idea--

289
00:20:56,533 --> 00:21:01,664
I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.

290
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,766
I mean, you said you were scared.

291
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:07,739
I mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?

292
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:10,675
I mean, like "when I moved to New York" scared.

293
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,749
Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.

294
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:22,085
But this is fine. This is gonna be good.

295
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:30,162
You should go.

296
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,825
What?

297
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:37,434
It's what you want. You should go.

298
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:40,105
You really think so?

299
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,042
I really do.

300
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,642
But I already told Zelner that I would come back.

301
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,411
I'm sure he'll understand.

302
00:21:55,725 --> 00:22:01,027
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna go to Paris!

303
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:03,764
Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,299
I'm going to Paris!

305
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:09,063
Thank you, Ross. Yeah, yeah.

306
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,741
Oh, I'm so happy.

307
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:18,070
Then I'm happy too.

308
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:30,518
Thank you all for coming.

309
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:36,927
We're here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent...and a beautiful woman.

310
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,764
Inside.

311
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:47,268
As Estelle's only two clients, we would like to say a few words.

312
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,679
Dude, where's my speech?

313
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,952
That is entertaining. Al Zebooker, everybody!
