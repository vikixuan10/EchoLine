00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,190
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,690
How did the job stuff go?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,580
He offered me one!

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,340
You know what?

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,690
This calls for a bottle of lsrael's finest!

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,120
The job is in Paris.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,320
Oh, God, please, somebody say something.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,410
So if you take this job,

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,360
you'll be moving to Paris?

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,000
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,860
I know, it's huge,

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,020
and it's scary

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,080
and it's really far away from you guys.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,370
But this is such an incredible opportunity for me.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,240
I've already told them about our situation with Emma...

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,530
...and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,160
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,080
they'll fly you out.

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,250
Anything we want.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,070
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,940
in my cubicle.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,960
All right. We'll work it out.

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,810
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,820
You sure this is what you want?

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,830
I think it is.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,860
What's going on?

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,270
I got a really incredible job offer.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,570
Hey, great! All right! - Good for you!

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,520
It's in Paris. - What?

30
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,200
No...

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,870
No, too much is changing, okay?

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,710
First Phoebe getting married.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,740
Congratulations.

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,700
And then these two move in to

35
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,800
a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

36
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,130
Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,200
It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!

38
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,240
You guys, this is really,

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,160
really important to me.

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,040
It means a lot

41
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,450
if you could try to get onboard.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,880
Of course we can. Congratulations.

43
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,340
Thank you.

44
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,410
Joey?

45
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,800
No, my hugs are reserved for people staying in America!

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,850
Joey, it would mean--

47
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,510
No! Get your France-going arms away from me!

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,660
Are you okay with this?

49
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,340
Well, it makes me feel sad, but--

50
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,260
Talking to Ross.

51
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,180
I see.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,740
Rachel moving to another country?

53
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,510
Not being able to see her every day?

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,730
How could I be okay with this?

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,960
But what are we gonna do?

56
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,740
She really needs this job.

57
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,230
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her her old job back,

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
she would take it?

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
How's that gonna happen?

60
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,470
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,330
Like, I don't know,

62
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,480
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

63
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,470
I met him at that Christmas party.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
I mean, we really hit it off.

65
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,100
The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?

66
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,900
I didn't say we were brothers!

67
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,450
Friends S10E15 The One Where Estelle Dies

68
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,700
Hey, Phoebe. Hey.

69
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,370
Hi.

70
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,690
The house next door to the one

71
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,230
that we're buying just went on the market.

72
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,450
I wanna take a look at it,

73
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,530
but Chandler doesn't.

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,820
We close escrow tomorrow.

75
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,640
Seeing another house can only confuse us.

76
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,930
We're easily confused.

77
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,380
We're not very bright.

78
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,440
But what if it's better than ours?

79
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,630
Shouldn't we look?

80
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,330
What do you think, Pheebs?

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,900
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like

82
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,640
you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Anyway....

84
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,880
Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?

85
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,470
Yeah.

86
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,400
She died. - You're kidding!

87
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,960
That's terrible. - Yeah, last Saturday.

88
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,460
Wow! She was the first black man

89
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,630
to fly solo across the Atlantic!

90
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,030
Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,910
Oh, yeah?

92
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,840
Yeah, she was just an agent.

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,430
Joey's gonna be so upset.

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,020
I know. He always wanted to be

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,480
the first black man to cross the Atlantic.

96
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,180
We cannot tell Joey about this.

97
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,400
He's already flipping out

98
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,650
about everything changing.

99
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,620
This'll push him over the edge.

100
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,360
You don't think we should tell him?

101
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,830
Not for a while.

102
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,020
Let's just give him a few days

103
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,560
to get used to everything else.

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,300
What if he reads the paper?

105
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,910
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,

106
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,340
I think we're okay.

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,680
May I help you?

108
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,660
Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,320
Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.

110
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,710
Oh, right. Don? - Close. Ron.

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,440
Well, what can I do for you?

112
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,540
Well, I'm here to see

113
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,330
if you'll give Rachel her job back.

114
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,360
Did she ask you to come here and do this?

115
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,530
First I have to get you to agree...

116
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,500
...then we'll see if she wants to come back.

117
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,000
Wow, that is tempting.

118
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,670
She loved her job here.

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone...

120
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,400
...who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?

121
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,070
She is good. - I took a shot there.

122
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,540
But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

123
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,650
Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.

124
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,450
I see.

125
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,210
Thanks very much.

126
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,380
Is this your son? - Yeah, his name is Ross.

127
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,760
What?

128
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,190
Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

129
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,570
Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?

130
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,890
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

131
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,110
How would he like to

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
come with me to the Museum of Natural History...

133
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,150
...after everyone else has left,

134
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,690
just the two of us...

135
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,780
...and he can touch anything he wants?

136
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,400
I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.

137
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,370
Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.

138
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,900
You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,970
You could really arrange that?

140
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,760
You let Rachel come back and it's done.

141
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,130
I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

142
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,350
Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.

143
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,970
I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.

144
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,550
That's great. I worry about little Ross.

145
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,180
He's always reading,

146
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,440
collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
He'll be fine!

148
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,500
Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.

149
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,100
Everything okay?

150
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm just mad at my agent.

151
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,350
Estelle? Why?

152
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,160
There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...

153
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,510
...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.

154
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,930
I'm guessing she does.

155
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,670
Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.

156
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,250
No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.

157
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,110
Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.

158
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, okay. Why?

159
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,820
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.

160
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,260
I love that saying!

161
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,830
Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.

162
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,030
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.

163
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,520
It's a little coincidental, but believable.

164
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,630
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,720
why I didn't get you...

166
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,330
...an audition for that TV movie.

167
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,790
Yeah, actually I am.

168
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,790
I guess I dropped the ball there.

169
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,450
That's it?

170
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,450
You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.

171
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,590
Don't take that tone with me.

172
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,930
Who do you think you are?

173
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,850
Alan Lemon,

174
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,520
the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?

175
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,640
No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...

176
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,660
...and you're not getting me any auditions

177
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,730
and I'm tired of it.

178
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,090
What are you saying?

179
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,250
I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

180
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,770
You're fired. Goodbye.

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,080
Man, tough week for Estelle.

182
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,790
Hi. - Hi.

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.

184
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,840
You know she can't sleep without it.

185
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,090
Well, she's asleep now.

186
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,850
Stop forcing that thing on her.

187
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,820
Okay.

188
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,310
You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!

189
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,600
Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!

190
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,010
No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

191
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,140
They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.

192
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,940
I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!

193
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,970
So you're not going to Paris?

194
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,660
No, I'm still going!

195
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,870
What?

196
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,950
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,690
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,

198
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,560
they offered me more money!

199
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,230
Ross, isn't that great?

200
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,710
Hi. We're buying the house next door.

201
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,570
Could we just take a look around?

202
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,270
Sure,

203
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm showing it to someone else right now,

204
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,160
but please, look around.

205
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,330
I feel like we're cheating on our house.

206
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,230
If we cheat, shouldn't it

207
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,630
be with a hot, younger house...

208
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,710
...that does stuff that our house won't do?

209
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,140
Ours is so much better!

210
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,110
This living room is smaller,

211
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,360
the dining room looks like a cave.

212
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,810
What a hole!

213
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,560
So, what do you think? - Love it!

214
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,870
We already have one offer.

215
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,010
I think the lady upstairs will make another one.

216
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,100
They could be our neighbors. What are they like?

217
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,670
The woman upstairs is nice.

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,330
She and her husband have two kids.

219
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,560
He's on Wall Street, and she's a--

220
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,560
Oh... my... God!

221
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,860
Sure.

222
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,280
Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?

223
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,110
Are you okay?

224
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,570
Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

225
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,290
This has gotta be killing her.

226
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,580
No, that wouldn't kill her.

227
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,270
A coronary embolism might.

228
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,770
I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.

229
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,230
Except for this guy who eats paper.

230
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,600
And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.

231
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,540
Look, I know she's not a great agent,

232
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,520
but she did stick with me for 10 years.

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,970
I'm gonna call her and hire her again.

234
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,110
No, no, no! Don't call her.

235
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,030
You wait for her to call you. - Why?

236
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,070
Because patience is the road to understanding.

237
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,400
Which is the key to a happy heart.

238
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,780
You blow me away.

239
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,980
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?

240
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,340
I promise. - Okay.

241
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,000
And that means never having to give a reason.

242
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,580
What a small world!

243
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,210
And yet I never run into Beyonce.

244
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,070
You two know each other?

245
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
We go way back.

246
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,680
Before Monica made an honest man out of him...

247
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,250
...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.

248
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,990
So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?

249
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,780
Are we gonna have a bidding war?

250
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,910
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

251
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,860
Don't...

252
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,140
Don't do that.

253
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,940
No, actually, we are buying the house next door.

254
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,600
Why?

255
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,260
I don't know why.

256
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,730
Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.

257
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,450
But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?

258
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,180
Now we have to get it!

259
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,450
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

260
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,010
This cannot be happening.

261
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,930
The realtor said another couple made an offer.

262
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,150
Maybe the Janices won't get it!

263
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,770
Maybe the other couple will.

264
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,490
The only way that'll happen is

265
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,790
if the other couple are the Hitlers!

266
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,990
Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?

267
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,170
We can turn this one into a guesthouse!

268
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,590
That's a great idea!

269
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,750
By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful...

270
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
...but when did you start crapping money?

271
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,830
You come up with an idea. - All right.

272
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,110
We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.

273
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,620
We can still get out.

274
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,840
But we love our house.

275
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,720
Will we love it so much with her next door?

276
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,840
And she's gonna be louder out here too!

277
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,080
Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"

278
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,560
Okay. But if we don't get this house,

279
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,540
she'll still show up wherever we go.

280
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,440
At least if she's here,

281
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,710
it eliminates the element of surprise.

282
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,290
Never again will you have to hear the three words...

283
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,000
...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!

284
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, we have to do something.

285
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,690
We can't have her living next door.

286
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,200
Oh, that does it too.

287
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,320
Who is it?

288
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,210
It's me. Ron.

289
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,900
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

290
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,650
...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.

291
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,560
This may surprise you,

292
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,400
but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.

293
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,910
Just hear me out.

294
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,970
How would you feel about offering her a raise?

295
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,540
Not good, Ron.

296
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,960
Perhaps I can persuade you.

297
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,790
What if you could give your son...

298
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,530
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,170
Wow! That's pretty cool.

300
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,080
So? Do we have a deal?

301
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,980
Okay, you got it. - Yes! Yes!

302
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,450
This is gonna make me very popular.

303
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,570
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

304
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,910
I meant with my son.

305
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,790
Good, because the ladies, not so much.

306
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,560
Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.

307
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,610
I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.

308
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,630
I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her...

309
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,410
...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 1O.

310
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,980
Hope you can make it.

311
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,770
Oh, my God.

312
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,650
Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.

313
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,840
Estelle?

314
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,480
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you

315
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,680
that there's no hard feelings for firing me.

316
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,110
Okay. I just-- I can't believe you're calling me.

317
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,560
I didn't think I should just drop by.

318
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,170
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

319
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,240
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.

320
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,510
Can I ask you something?

321
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,480
What's it like there?

322
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,050
It's all right.

323
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,540
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

324
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,740
Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge!

325
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,950
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

326
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,800
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!

327
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,790
Well, I just talked to Sid.

328
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,480
We are definitely putting in an offer on the house.

329
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,510
And I'll bet we get it!

330
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,790
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

331
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,340
All right, I gotta run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.

332
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,800
I'll see you later, neighbor.

333
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,450
Wait!

334
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,060
I just want you to know that I'm so happy you're going to be here.

335
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,340
Oh, me too!

336
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,990
Because...

337
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,650
...that way...

338
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,140
...we can pick up where we left off.

339
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,160
I never stopped loving you.

340
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,250
Oh... my-- - Yeah...

341
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,730
I want you.

342
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,830
I need you.

343
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,470
I must have you,

344
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,660
Janice Litman-Goralnik ne Hosenstein.

345
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,930
Chandler, what are you talking about?

346
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.

347
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,170
Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.

348
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,480
I don't know what to say.

349
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,930
I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,350
Obviously.

351
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,810
But I love my husband.

352
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,590
And I know you love your wife.

353
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,810
I don't think we should get this house now.

354
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,200
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream and take it away.

355
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,860
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.

356
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,620
I understand.

357
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,910
Although....

358
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,530
Maybe just one last moment of weakness.

359
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,710
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

360
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,590
They're never coming down now!

361
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,060
Hi. - Hi!

362
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,030
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.

363
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,910
What?

364
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,270
Ralph Lauren called, again,

365
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,700
and they offered me more money.

366
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,880
They did? - Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

367
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,480
Zelner called me and said, "We will do anything we can to get you back."

368
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,800
And that I should thank some "Ron."

369
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,930
I don't even know what department that guy's in!

370
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,500
So, what are you gonna do? - Well, I took it!

371
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,020
That's great! So you're staying in New York!

372
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,560
You're excited, right?

373
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,270
You know, the money's great.

374
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,980
It's certainly the easier choice. - Right.

375
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,860
But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.

376
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,330
Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?

377
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,070
Oh, absolutely.

378
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,820
Yeah, but you know, this is....

379
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,130
It's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much...

380
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,220
...gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.

381
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,600
I had no idea--

382
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,340
I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.

383
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,300
I mean, you said you were scared.

384
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,950
I mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?

385
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,940
I mean, like "when I moved to New York" scared.

386
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,370
Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.

387
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,680
But this is fine. This is gonna be good.

388
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,120
You should go.

389
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,690
What?

390
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,450
It's what you want. You should go.

391
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,460
You really think so?

392
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,080
I really do.

393
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,580
But I already told Zelner that I would come back.

394
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,860
I'm sure he'll understand.

395
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,340
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna go to Paris!

396
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,070
Yeah. - Yeah.

397
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm going to Paris!

398
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,370
Thank you, Ross. - Yeah, yeah.

399
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,590
Oh, I'm so happy.

400
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,100
Then I'm happy too.

401
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,270
Thank you all for coming.

402
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,900
We're here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent...

403
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,620
...and a beautiful woman.

404
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,440
Inside.

405
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,570
As Estelle's only two clients,

406
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,700
we would like to say a few words.

407
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,130
Dude, where's my speech?

408
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,740
That is entertaining.

409
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,720
Al Zebooker, everybody!
